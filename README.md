# In most cases, decompiled program code is difficult to analyze: the names of variables and functions are devoid of their original meaning and the logic of the program is difficult to trace. During the work on the project, an adapter for the CodeLlama language model was trained, designed to improve the decompiled C code: to approximate the source code of the program and simplify it for human perception. The possibilities of the adapter have also been investigated and its effectiveness in solving this problem has been evaluated. All the details are in the explanatory note.
